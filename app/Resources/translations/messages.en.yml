'_MS_S3_PARAGRAPH_2_': That's only a selection of the most prominent features and benefits, the list goes on and on. Magento also offers advanced reporting and is easy to fully connect to Google Analytics. Additionally, it contains a simple but efficient CMS to manage static pages and blocks.

'_MS_S5_PARAGRAPH_1_': That means there’s always room to give you more… of everything!
'_MS_S5_PARAGRAPH_2_': Magento’s flexibility allows endless customisation and the ability to expand in any direction, by inviting developers to create a community of modders with thousands of ready-made solutions. Choose any function you need and you can find support for what you want to do. <br> There are currently 25,000+ Magento extensions available, most of them free or very affordable. Extensions to manage gift cards, reward points, loyalty programs, affiliate networks, advanced search engines – everything you need is already out there. <br> And we can bring it all to your doorstep. Additionally, we can create new modules for you, built precisely to your specifications.
'_MS_S5_PARAGRAPH_3_': ''
    
'_MS_S6_TITLE_HEADER_': SCALABILITY
'_MS_S6_PARAGRAPH_1_': How many items do you have in your store inventory?
'_MS_S6_PARAGRAPH_2_': Trick question! Magento doesn't care. It is optimised to effortlessly manage any size store, whether you have 10 products or 10,000. Thanks to efficient indexing, Magento can easily handle 500,000 products and some shops run 1 million+ SKUs!   
    
'_MS_S7_TITLE_HEADER_': MULTI-STORE CAPABILITIES
'_MS_S7_PARAGRAPH_1_': Maybe your product diversity is better served by multiple store fronts? Or you want to organise according to region? Or you need to specify service provider according to market?

'_MS_S8_TITLE_HEADER_': SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION (SEO)
'_MS_S8_PARAGRAPH_1_': "Effective SEO is critical to your business – it powers your ability to connect with customers and the marketplace. We’ll be honest: Magento won't do it for you by itself, but it can hep you a lot. <br> Magento generates SEO-friendly URLs and sitemaps, the kind that Google loves to rank above those of your competitors. It also allows you to define meta data in a very convenient and useful way. Best of all, Magento’s advanced SEO toolkit can be further extended with plugins – you choose the SEO performance you need and we'll make it happen!"
    
'_MS_S9_TITLE_HEADER_': SAFETY
'_MS_S9_PARAGRAPH_1_': It’s a priority that includes data safety, transaction security, and file protection. There are many dangers online and 100% security is a myth.
'_MS_S9_PARAGRAPH_2_': Magento understands that and provides you with regular updates. The platform is constantly tested by the community of developers and security experts, who spot and repair vulnerabilities as they happen. Security patches are necessary and Magento prioritises solutions.

'_FES_S3_TITLE_HEADER_': CLIENTS BUY WITH THEIR EYES

'_FES_S4_TITLE_HEADER_': CRITICAL DETAILS
'_FES_S4_PARAGRAPH1_': Effective front end development is about managing the details that elevate your website from the crowd.

'_FES_S5_TITLE_HEADER_': QUALITY VS QUANTITY
'_FES_S5_PARAGRAPH1_': Exceptional front end development requires understanding the fine line between “just right” and “too much.” It's easy to load up on graphics, special effects, and gadgets, but it's quite a bit more difficult knowing where to draw the line to ensure best performance and superior cross-device compatibility. <br><br> Your website needs to be attractive & appealing, without sacrificing speed or accessibility... and we can help you with that!
    
'_FES_S6_TITLE_HEADER_': WE HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE
'_FES_S6_PARAGRAPH1_': We also have the talent, and the desire to innovate, and an unmatched commitment to our clients. With great power comes great responsibility, or so we've been told.

'_SZS_S2_TITLE_HEADER_': YOU WANT SUPERIOR FLEXIBILITY
'_SZS_S2_PARAGRAPH1_': 'Symfony 3 is an open source platform, which has spurred a large and capable development community that delivers innovative extensions and expanded functionalities on a daily basis. The benefit to users is obvious: the correct configuration of Symfony and Zend allow them to do whatever you need them to do.'
'_SZS_S2_PARAGRAPH2_':  This flexibility means performance can be tailored across industries, specialities, languages, compatibilities, and more... and that's kind of our speciality!
    
'_SZS_S3_TITLE_HEADER_': YOU WANT OPTIMAL EFFICIENCY
'_SZS_S3_PARAGRAPH1_': Symfony and Zend are engineered to utilise PHP language extremely efficiently. That level of optimisation reduces the time, effort, and resources expended during development and testing. Downstream requirements for maintenance are also smaller. <br><br> These efficiency benefits are achieved without sacrificing quality, which makes Symfony and Zend all the more attractive.
    
'_SZS_S4_TITLE_HEADER_': YOU WANT SAFETY YOU CAN TRUST
'_SZS_S4_PARAGRAPH1_': "Websites based on Symfony and Zend are distinguished by their record for safety and limited vulnerability. Zend was originated by the creators of the PHP language: their familiarity and adherence to development best practices has ensured Zend is airtight. <br><br> We are able to build your website or application with best security performance."
    
'_SZS_S5_TITLE_HEADER_': YOU WANT SIMPLICITY & SUPPORT
'_SZS_S5_PARAGRAPH1_': Add simplicity to the benefits listed above. The platforms are engineered for ease of use. That's a major reason Zend has been implemented on 75 million+ projects worldwide. <br><br> And when there is a problem? Tech support for developers is available 24/7, alongside comprehensive libraries with additional help. Our clients enjoy the best reliability available.

Our design process is iterative: the prototype is consulted, amended, and re-consulted until we reach a design that is superb."
    
'_UXS_S5_TITLE_HEADER_': PRODUCTION
'_UXS_S5_PARAGRAPH1_': "Target graphic design is conceptualised, approved, and forwarded to the development team. We create a schedule, which we review with you: this allows you to follow along during implementation. Throughout implementation, your product is routinely tested and re-tested, until it's perfect. <br><br> Not just good... P-E-R-F-E-C-T."
    
'_UXS_S6_TITLE_HEADER_': WE GO LIVE
'_UXS_S6_PARAGRAPH1_': "Everyone's favourite part: we go live with your project. Think that's the end? Not for us. Every infant needs attention, care, and support. We stay with you to ensure everything is working smoothly, with troubleshooting and improvement wherever needed."
'_UXS_S6_PARAGRAPH2_': Once your baby is all grown up and ready to face the world, it's okay to cry :)
    
'_UXS_S7_TITLE_HEADER_': SUMMARY
'_UXS_S7_PARAGRAPH1_': Our UX & UI design process is successful and proven. We are diligent, experienced, and motivated to meet your strategies & goals with a product that is sleek, efficient, reliable, and tuned to thrill your customers. Thanks to an iterative, cycle-based work methodology we are able to anticipate challenges, successfully adapt, and facilitate your project's evolution.
'_UXS_S7_PARAGRAPH2_': "And if it sounds like we're bound up in our process, don't worry: we always know how to customise based on your individual requirements for budget, schedule, resources, and performance goals. <br><br> Trust us, we've done this before. We look forward to doing it for you!"
    
'_UXS_REALIZATION_1_TITLE_1_': The best way to find a soulmate!
'_UXS_REALIZATION_1_TITLE_2_': ''
'_UXS_REALIZATION_1_PARAGRAPH_1_': Our client asked us to do our best and make looking for the significant other as simple and accurate as possible. In order to do that, we designed and built a website based on PHP ZEND which has become a truly unique place for the Poles staying abroad.
    
'_UXS_REALIZATION_2_TITLE_1_': Clothes for every occasion
'_UXS_REALIZATION_2_TITLE_2_': ''
'_UXS_REALIZATION_2_PARAGRAPH_1_': We were faced with a challenge of creating a visually-appealing, modern store. Sure enough, Magento turned out to be the most suitable solution. We accompanied the store with an Advox-made graphic design.

'_AU_ANCHOR_1': HOW WE WORK
'_AU_ANCHOR_2': OUR HISTORY
'_AU_ANCHOR_3': ATMOSPHERE

'_AU_S1_TITLE_HEADER_': ABOUT-US
'_AU_S1_PARAGRAPH1_': Who are we?<br>What are we doing?
'_AU_S1_PARAGRAPH2_': Get to know our team and why bringing us into your project is so fun.
'_AU_S1_PARAGRAPH3_': Every project is not just a challenge, it’s a new adventure!

'_AU_S2_TITLE_HEADER_': HOW WE WORK
'_AU_S2_PARAGRAPH1_': Scrum is our second language. We develop projects at full Sprint(s), using an Agile method to anticipate and negotiate obstacles. But we're about more than just doing things by the book.
'_AU_S2_PARAGRAPH2_': The development world doesn't stand still and neither do we. We stay in tune with the times and follow the guidelines of the Agile manifesto, but we realise development has a rich tradition of successful alternative organisational frameworks. When a Cascade model is called for, we shift gears and modify our implementation accordingly.

'_AU_S3_TITLE_HEADER_': WE LOVE TO HIT OUR BENCHMARKS
'_AU_S3_PARAGRAPH1_': Results are a top priority. When we make decisions, they are always considered within the context of your needs and challenges. We understand the importance of efficiency and cost-benefit relationships, because those directly impact results.
'_AU_S3_PARAGRAPH2_': When you choose to bring us aboard your project, it's not just a business relationship for us. It's a challenge, an adventure, and an opportunity to apply our talent to engineer a new solution. That's fun for us!
'_AU_S3_PARAGRAPH3_': We don't disappear behind a curtain to work our magic, we know you're invested in the process as well as the results. Thanks to JIRA and Redmine - tracking softwares we use to efficiently manage your project - you can stay informed and take part as a team member.

'_AU_S4_TITLE_HEADER_': UNIQUE ATMOSPHERE
'_AU_S4_PARAGRAPH1_': Deadlines, targets, benchmarks, metrics - these words can make it difficult to understand our process. That’s why we stay away from procedural buzzwords and host a fun and supportive office.
'_AU_S4_PARAGRAPH2_': We indulge just the right work/life balance, within a laid back atmosphere.

'_AU_S5_TITLE_HEADER_': CHILLING OUT
'_AU_S5_PARAGRAPH1_': Some of our fiercest rivalries are with ourselves – the daily table football games can become heated. If you're not already an expert player, you will be.
'_AU_S5_PARAGRAPH2_': You will be...

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_1' :   '06.12.2016'
'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_1':   'Say hello to our new website!'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_1': 'We are proud to present you the new design of our website.'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_1': After a genuine drudgery and dozens of projects, finally the new version of Advox has been born. We hope it strikes a chord with you and will be as useful as we expect it to be. Follow the signs!

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_2' :   '19.09.2016'
'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_2':   'Meet Magento Poland 2016!'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_2': 'Meet Magento Poland 2016 is underway and Advox, again, has decided to sponsor the event.'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_2_1': Meet Magento is an event that is an absolute must-be for all the people interested in e-commerce. That multinational conference is also held in Poland, specifically in Poznań. For two days, all the attendees had a chance to take part in passionate discussions about the development of Magento platform itself or online stores. Special workshops and lectures were also an opportunity to find solutions for common problems.
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_2_2': Advox would never pass on an opportunity to join such an event. For three years we have been sponsoring Meet Magento Poland. Our developers and PMs are also among the participants!

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_3' :   '16.09.2016'
'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_3':   'Magento Registered Partner'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_3': 'We are proud to announce that Advox has been awarded the Magento Partner status.'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_3': 'Magento eCommerce is our specialty. We consistently try to hone our skills on this platform, develop our cooperation and that has resulted in us becoming Magento Partners. And this is not our last word, by any means!'

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_4' :   '20.08.2016'
'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_4':   'PHPers Summit 2016'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_4': 'Advox was a silver sponsor of PHPers Summit conference!'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_4': PHPers Summit was the first event in Poland which gathered the PHP developers. On 20th October 2016 Poznań was home to hundreds of PHP-passionate specialists from Poland. An all day long conference was brimming with inspiring lectures, interesting discussions and meetings between people from the industry. Advox fully supports this type of meetings!

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_5' :   '21.04.2015'

'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_6':   'Holiday delays!'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_6': 'Sometimes you just need to get some rest from work...'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_6': Dear Customers, <br><br> Yesterday evening we received a rather surprising but very happy news- one of Advox’s programmers, Karol, has won the lottery. But wait, there’s more – it was not a meagre couple of millions but waaay more than that. We rubbed our eyes in disbelief but … it’s true. <br><br> Karol was always open-handed which made him buy us a multi-pack of cola, pizza with caper and Norwegian salmon for the whole company. Just out of him being Karol. <br><br> But this time, however, he went on a spending spree.  <br><br> We regret not to inform each and every one of our customers but in a few hours we have a plane and there is still our luggage to be packed. After all, one does need to get ready for a holiday in a Gabonese jungle. We may stay out of the Internet’s reach so completing your projects is rather bound to delay. Or, forget about “rather” – it is sure to delay. <br><br> However, let us promise to jump right back to them right after we come back.  <br><br> Or … the moment our boss is going to discipline us. Which is … in just am moment.

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_7' :   '07.07.2014'
'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_7':   'Graphic Designer Wanted'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_7': 'Fancy joining our Advox family?'

If you feel the same – send us your portfolio and CV.  <br><br> We hire the best only – it’s time for you to come and knock us off our feet.

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_8' :   '13.08.2013'
'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_8':   'We have Magento developer certificate!'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_8': 'New Magento developers on board!'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_8': Our programmer, Paweł, has joined the group of only 20 certified Magento Developer specialists in Poland. That certificate is the definite proof of his exceptional abilities and a guarantee that shops that he created are reliable.   <br><br> Paweł is a great example of the fact that Advox works only with the best ones.   <br><br> If you want to learn more about Paweł’s recently acquired certificate – go here. <br><br> Visiting Realizations tab you may see some of his works. <br><br> If you are still wondering who to put your trust with when it comes to your internet project – call us immediately. 

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_9' :   '21.05.2013'
'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_9':   'Urgently wanted: New Business Manager'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_9': 'We are not bothered by the recession - join our team!'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_9': Despite our efforts we still haven’t managed to notice any signs of the economic crisis. Moreover, we have just started a recruitment for a post of New Business Manager for the European market. The candidate will be expected to seek new clients in a specified country. Our main criterion is the knowledge of one of the following languages- German, Greek, French, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Lithuanian or Italian. <br><br>

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_10' :   '29.03.2013'

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_11' :   '08.02.2013'
'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_11':   'Kamyk is live'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_11': 'Yet another of our Magento projects is now live!'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_11': From the things that deserve to be mentioned are- we improved this poor Magento search engine; shopping cart is now in AJAX and some other curiosities that make user's life easier - that's all from the programming site of the project. <br><br> As for the graphics, here was one important rule (repeated like a mantra by hundreds of designers), "less is more". As the main recipient of the products are women, the shop has a rather subtle line and details highlight to whom it is directed. <br><br> Immodestly we must say that we like it ). <br><br> We hope that you like it too, and we would love it if Kamyk's customers like it.

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_12' :   '02.01.2013'

'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_13':   'Facebook Campaign for Yasumi Epil'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_13': 'How to leave a mark in the social media? When it comes to it, we’re second to none!'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_13': The campaign`s objective was to promote the brand on Facebook (from the scratch!). We weren`t just looking for any fans, but potential clients! <br><br> Summer was due, hence the calculation was quite simple- summer + depilation = beach. Yasumi beach, to be more precise! At this beach everyone is smooth and beautiful, like in Baywatch! <br> The results were quite spectacular. You can read the whole case study here. 

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_14' :   '26.09.2012'
'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_14':   'Small Homeland 2.0.'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_14': 'Beta version of Kalisz Museum of Photography online'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_14': We wish the authors of the project best of luck and promise that we’ll still provide the project with technical support.   <br><br> After a couple of weeks of work done by our graphic designer and programmers we managed to create a nice project. With only a few minor corrections it is going to be a real top-notch job. We certainly hope that we have managed to contribute a bit to the history of this amazing city. The very photos are really worth watching and so are the stories of the most notable inhabitants.

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_15' :   '17.03.2012'

'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_16': It is warm (which was hard to achieve during past few days), bright and close to the centre. <br><br> Well, the new office filled us with free energy & energy, because we have never lacked enthusiasm.

'TMP_NEWS_DATE_17' :   '12.12.2011'
'TMP_NEWS_TITLE_17':   'Grab your free campaign'
'TMP_NEWS_SNIPPET_17': 'Test a campaign totally for free!'
'TMP_NEWS_TEXT_17': If everyone is at it, we could not resist and jumped on the bandwagon- till Christmas all business can try a sponsored-links campaign totally free of charge. <br><br> 

'TMP_NEWS_AUTHOR_1' : 'Kornelia'
'TMP_NEWS_AUTHORDESC_1' : 'A genuine energy-geyser and a chatterbox. Yet, she is also very apt at listening to clients, in an almost-psychotherapeutic fashion.'

'TMP_NEWS_AUTHOR_2' : 'Ela'
'TMP_NEWS_AUTHORDESC_2' : "Our keyword specialist is a truly versatile person – she won't dodge any type of work. Also, we have yet to find a bigger globetrotter and more likeable individual. She loves lofty discussions, staying fit and (very occasional) table football ass-kicking."

'TMP_NEWS_AUTHOR_3' : 'Michał'
'TMP_NEWS_AUTHORDESC_3' : "A PM with stellar work-ethic who can face even the most daunting of deadlines. In his leisure time, he writes and publishes articles about the world conflicts which often miss the headlines. Apart from that – he plays bass and gets on the developer's nerves. But who would stand up to him, knowing that Michał also trains jiu jitsu?"

'TMP_NEWS_AUTHOR_4' : 'Sebastian'
'TMP_NEWS_AUTHORDESC_4' : 'A master of wry sense of humour, both in Polish and English. He converts his linguistic talents into efficient project management. Once based in Iława, now is a proud inhabitant of Poznań. Owner of the skinniest wrist in this part of the world.'

'TMP_NEWS_AUTHOR_5' : 'Damian'
'TMP_NEWS_AUTHORDESC_5' : "Born to complain. He utilizes his nitpicking talent as our tester and developer's nuisance."
